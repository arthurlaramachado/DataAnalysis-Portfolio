### Important Notes
 - The following work has been done based on projects of the YouTube channel "Alex The Analyst", in the "Data Analyst Portfolio Projects" playlist. It's is important to highlight that Alex gave his permission to use the code developed with his help as a Portfolio project.
 
 - If you want to copy and use this code lines be aware that some might not work depending on the way data was imported to your own database. To fix that, will be needed just a few minor changes related to data type, since the logic should not be the problem.
